## About Me Page for Esmeralda Quezada 
#### Her Live site: https://esmeralda-quezada.netlify.app/

### Her story:

*Esmeralda is a software engineer who proudly embraces her Mexican heritage. To bring her personality into the design, she requested a theme inspired by Mexican culture, with blue as her signature color. 
I incorporated various cultural backgrounds throughout the page to tell her story visually. As an accomplished marathon runner who completed a 26-mile race, it felt fitting to include a playful Sonic GIF to 
highlight her passion for running. This "About Me" page authentically reflects Esmeralda â€” a proud Mexican, a dedicated engineer, and a strong athlete.*

### Key Features:
* Used percentages, `rem`/`em`, and Flexbox to make the website responsive across all devices. (See the video below.)
* Added a hamburger menu for mobile responsiveness.
* Included a curved-like SVG effect on the website.
* Used a wooden texture image under each navigation item in the menu bar.

### Push Work & Resources:

* I had to figure out how to create a hamburger menu. I ended up using [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_responsive_navbar_dropdown.asp) to get the base code and used CodePen to break it down and learn how to implement it myself.
* I added a curved-like SVG to the website using [shapedivider.app](https://www.shapedivider.app/). I also had to experiment with it because it required the parent element to have `position: relative`, which needed a bit of troubleshooting.
* For adding the wooden texture image under each navigation item, I ended up using ChatGPT for help, of course.
